> An open forum platform made for developers and programmers.

Greenline was built to foster learning through visual communication of code challenges and solutions. Inspired by Stack Overflow, it introduces a clean, user-friendly way to **collaborate**, **highlight code issues visually**, and **engage with a coding community**.

## 📌 Original Description

Greenline is an open forum for programmers/developers just like Stack Overflow.

But what makes this different is it focuses on helping others understand a code by **adding a container where the code is written and highlight specific areas in red** (which is a problem area).

This creates a **collaborative learning environment** where users can:

- Post problems with visual indicators
- Seek solutions from others in a simplified and readable format
- Learn from highlighted errors and feedback from the community
